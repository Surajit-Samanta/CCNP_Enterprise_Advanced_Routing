1.1.1 Introduction - IPv4/IPv6 Addressing and Routing Review
This chapter covers the following content:

IPv4 Addressing: This section provides a review of IPv4 addressing and covers issues you might face and how to troubleshoot them.
DHCP for IPv4: This section reviews DHCP for IPv4 operations, explores potential DHCP issues, and examines the output of various DHCP show commands.
IPv6 Addressing: This section provides a brief review of IPv6 addressing.
IPv6 SLAAC, Stateful DHCPv6, and Stateless DHCPv6: This section explores how clients obtain IPv6 addressing information using SLACC, stateful DHCPv6, and stateless DHCPv6.
Packet-Forwarding Process: This section discusses the packet-forwarding process and the commands to verify the entries in the data structures that are used for this process. It also provides you with a collection of Cisco IOS Software commands that could prove useful when troubleshooting related issues.
Routing Information Sources: This section explains which sources of routing information are the most believable and how the routing table interacts with various data structures to populate itself with the best information.
Static Routes: This section reviews how to configure and verify IPv4 and IPv6 static routes.
Trouble Tickets: This section provides a number of trouble tickets that demonstrate how a structured troubleshooting process is used to solve a reported problem.

Troubleshoot Static Routing
Question 1
What do devices on the same IPv4 subnet have in common?


radio_button_unchecked
They all use the same default gateway.

radio_button_unchecked
They all have a subnet mask of /8, /16, or /24.

radio_button_unchecked
They all have the same last octet in their IPv4 addresses.

radio_button_unchecked
They all have the same number in the first three octets of their IPv4 address.
Question 2
The graphic shows a network with devices connected as follows:  
Router R1, interface G0/1 is connected to router R2, interface G0/1. G0/1 on R1 has IP address 10.0.01/30 and G0/1 on R2 has IP address 10.0.0.2/30. The DHCPv4 server is connected to R2 on interface G0/0. R2 interface G0/0 has IP address 10.2.0.254/16 and the DHCPv4 server has IPv4 address 10.2.0.250. The new subnet is connected to router R1 on interface G0/0, which has IP address 10.1.0.254/16.
Refer to the exhibit. A network administrator has added a new subnet to the network and needs hosts on that subnet to receive IPv4 addresses from the DHCPv4 server.
What two commands will allow hosts on the new subnet to receive addresses from the DHCP4 server? (Choose two.)


check_box_outline_blank
R1(config)# interface G0/0

check_box_outline_blank
R1(config-if)# ip helper-address 10.2.0.250

check_box_outline_blank
R2(config)# interface G0/0

check_box_outline_blank
R2(config-if)# ip helper-address 10.2.0.250

check_box_outline_blank
R1(config-if)# ip helper-address 10.1.0.254

check_box_outline_blank
R1(config)# interface G0/1
Question 3
The exhibit shows the following commands configured on router R1:<br>R1(config)# interface fastethernet 0/0<br>R1(config-if)# ipv6 address 2000:db8:c18:1::/64 eui-64<br>R1(config-if)# no shutdown<br>R1(config-if)# exit
Refer to the exhibit. How will R1 generate the interface ID portion of the IPv6 address on interface FastEthernet 0/0?


radio_button_unchecked
By using stateful DHCP

radio_button_unchecked
By using a manually set value of 64

radio_button_unchecked
By using a randomly generated 64-bit number

radio_button_unchecked
By using the interface MAC address with a 16-bit filler
Question 4
What is the function of ARP?


radio_button_unchecked
Resolves domain names to IP addresses

radio_button_unchecked
Provides automatic IP address assignments to hosts

radio_button_unchecked
Sends error and operational information messages to hosts

radio_button_unchecked
Maps IPv4 addresses to MAC addresses
Question 5
The exhibit shows two PCs called PC A and PC B, two routes called R1 and R2, and two switches. PC A has the address 172.16.1.1/24 and is connected to a switch and into an interface on R1 that has the IP address 172.16.1.254. PC B has the address 172.16.2.1/24 and is connected to a switch that is connected to another interface on R1 with the IP address 172.16.2.254. The serial interface on R1 has the address 172.16.3.1 and is connected to the serial interface on R2 that has the address 172.16.3.2/24. R2 is connected to the internet cloud.
Which command will create a static route on R2 in order to reach PC B?
